/*
 * I want this class to learn about the player constantly. It needs to observe the player and from there, decide how to suit the level
 * for the player. We don't have many enemies yet, but we should later have enemies with unique characteristics and features. The class
 * should know how often the player shoots, accuracy, how much the player moves or jitters. Place tanky enemies, quick enemies, anything
 * to make the player adapt, even if it's only a little. The class should also make sure that the player gets a good variety of enemies,
 * not just one type of enemy all the time. I, subsage will handle it, unless anyone else wants to, going to bed.
